## Description
Using mysql and inquirer, make a database system that can add/view employee, add/view role, add/view department and update an employee's role. In this project I used promise query to solved the synchronization issue between the query and the inquirer. For this project to work, user must install create_db.sql and seed_records.sql either in mysql from the terminal or from my sql bench. Just copy and paste the sql statements from my file to terminal or workbench. I have the package.json included. Running npm install should install inquirer and my sql.
